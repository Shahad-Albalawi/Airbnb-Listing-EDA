# Airbnb-Listing-EDA
This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listings data. The analysis is based on a dataset containing information about listings, such as prices, room types, number of reviews, and more.

## Requirements
To run the project, you will need the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset (e.g., `listings.csv`) and place it in the project directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Airbnb_Listing_EDA.ipynb`.
3. Execute the cells in order to perform the analysis and view the results.

## Data Analysis
The project includes data cleaning steps to handle missing values and analyze trends such as:
- Distribution of room types
- Price variations across different neighborhoods
- Relationship between number of reviews and listing prices

## Visualizations
Several visualizations are created to illustrate the findings, including:
- Pie charts for room type distribution
- Scatter plots showing price vs. number of reviews
- Box plots for minimum night requirements

## Findings
Key insights from the analysis include:
- The most popular types of rooms
- Price trends in various neighborhoods
- Correlation between reviews and pricing
